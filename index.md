## Overview

The **Ethereum Wallet Grabber Balance Checker** is a powerful Python tool designed for managing Ethereum wallets. This tool scans multiple wallets, checks their balances, and facilitates fund transfers from wallets that meet a specified balance threshold. It leverages multithreading for efficient, parallel wallet scanning and transaction processing.

## Features

- **Wallet Scanning**: Quickly scan Ethereum wallets for balance information.
- **Balance Checking**: Check balances against a user-defined threshold.
- **Automated Transfers**: Transfer funds from wallets that meet your criteria.
- **Multithreading**: Efficiently handle multiple wallets simultaneously for faster processing.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple interface for ease of use.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/makoff08/Ethereum-Wallet-Grabber-Balance-Checker.git
cd Ethereum-Wallet-Grabber-Balance-Checker
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can start using the tool. Follow these steps:

1. **Configure Your Wallets**: Create a configuration file with your Ethereum wallet addresses and private keys.
2. **Set Balance Threshold**: Define the minimum balance required for transfers.
3. **Run the Tool**: Execute the script to start scanning and transferring funds.

```bash
python wallet_grabber.py
```

### Example Configuration File

Create a file named `config.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "wallets": [
    {
      "address": "0xYourWalletAddress1",
      "private_key": "YourPrivateKey1"
    },
    {
      "address": "0xYourWalletAddress2",
      "private_key": "YourPrivateKey2"
    }
  ],
  "balance_threshold": 0.1
}
```

### Scanning and Transferring

The tool will scan the specified wallets and check their balances. If a wallet's balance exceeds the defined threshold, the tool will initiate a transfer to your specified destination address.
